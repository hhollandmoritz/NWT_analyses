Niwot Modeling README

This is a directory to keep track of  progress for using NWT data in CLM simulations.
The broad goal of the work is to develop scripts and workflow to  more easily update CLM simulations with new NWT data.

Here's a space wehre we can keep track of what has been done and needs to be addressed.

__Forcing data__ 
* Revisit and update data Tvan E & W tower data
* Gapfill Tvan observations with data from other tower (when necessary)
* Develop pipeline to bring in other measurements (Saddle precip, US-NR1 solar radiation, etc.)
[ ] Run with NEON NIWO met data instead data (2018-2019 only).

__Observational data__
* Saddle snow grid
* Saddle productivity
* Sensor network
*
